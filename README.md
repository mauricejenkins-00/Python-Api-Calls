# Python-Api-Calls
Practice creating api calls utilizing python libraries to gather information on establishments in a specific coordinate radius.

Objectives: 

  Declare a set of variables to be later utilized in making calls to Googles Places API.
  
  Create a for loop to iterate through our list of coordinate values using a set group of params.
  
  Store the returned information in a list after using the requests library to connect to the API.
  
  Convert the JSON data into organized dataframes, and save the data to CSV files to later use. 
  
  Comparing the values of the dataframes using Matplotlib, to find the coordinate locations with the most expensive, and populated establishment areas. Using these findings to create visualizations to be stored.
